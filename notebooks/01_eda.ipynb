    "### Data Formatting and Consistency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigation of the key data fields raises multiple issues with the data collected, which needs to be addressed during the data cleaning stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Trailing Spaces**: Columns have trailing whitespaces in their values as indicated by  `' '` as well as `\\n` and `\\t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capitalisation Inconsistency**: In particular, categorical columns have similar entries with inconsistent capitalisation: lower case, upper case, and both.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Format Inconsistency**: Columns have unnecessary characters in their records such as \"pts\", \"+\" and \"Age\" in the `Age` column, which do not add any value to the analysis. Numeric columns have redundant decimal points in their values as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid Values**: Columns have invalid values that do not fall into the categories assigned, such as \"Mixed\" and \"Flexible\" in the `Work_Arrangement` column, which can only accept categories such as \"Onsite\", \"Remote\" or \"Hybrid\". Another class of invalid values are values that fall out of scale such as records that are greater than 5 in the `Social_Isolation_Score` column, or impossible values like \"0.0\" and \"1995\" in the `Age` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inconsistent Columns**: The `Salary_Range` column contains heavily overlapping and inconsistently defined salary brackets (\"$40K-$60K\" and \"$50K-$70K\").

    "The missing values in these columns were addressed using different strategies based on the nature of each variable and the proportion of missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Burnout_Level**: Missing values were dropped as they accounted for less than 5% of the values in the dataset (4.95%). Given the low proportion of missing data, deletion of these values were appropriate to maintain data integrity without significant reduction in sample size \n",
    "\n",
    "**Age**: Missing values were imputed using median values grouped by `Job_Role` and `Industry`. This approach leverages the fact that different roles within specific industries tend to attract workers of similar age demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hours_Per_Week**: Missing values were imputed using median values grouped by `Job_Role` and `Work_Arrangement`, as working hours differ significantly between different job positions and whether they work remotely or in-office.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social_Isolation_Score**: Missing values were imputed using median values grouped by `Work_Arrangement` and `Mental_Health_Issues_Binary`, given that work arrangements influences human interactions and the state of one's mental health which would influence feelings of social isolation to varying degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work_Life_Balance_Score**: Missing values were imputed using median values grouped by `Work_Arrangement` and `Industry`, as work-life balance expectations and practises would vary considerably across different industries and work arrangements. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mental_Health_Issues** & **Physical_Health_Issues**: Missing values will not be dropped nor imputed due to the wide variability of free-text response. Instead, their responses or lack of response would be assigned a Binary value in the `Mental_Health_Issues_Binary` and `Physical_Health_Issues_Binary` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For grouped imputation methods, when specific group combinations do not have any valid data and a median value is unable to be obtained, missing values for that group combination would be filled with the column's overall median value as a fallback strategy. For instance, in the `Work_Life_Balance_Score` column, there were a total of 12 records with no valid values for certain `Work_Arrangement` and `Industry` combinations. These values were filled with the median value of the `Work_Life_Balance_Score`, which would unlikely cause any bias in the analysis as they only account for 0.25% of the entire dataset."
